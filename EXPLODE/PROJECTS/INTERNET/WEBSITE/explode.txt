Explode.Exe is a Delphi+OpenGL mprogram that simulates an explosion with
particles (3072 tiny triangles). In software mode the frame rate is decent.
With hardware acceleration the explosion may be almost too fast to see.

When the program is running, press the space bar each time you want to see
an explosion.
